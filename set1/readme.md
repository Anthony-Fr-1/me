I think the interface of vs code and setup is quite overwhelming. I do appreciate that whenever starting something new, its always best to start with good habits. I feel this system will put me in good stead for the future so long as i can remember it all haha

I think learning anything that is new is hard. I've only ever done very basic copy paste coding in the past. And by the past, I mean i've only touched code since about september last year where I had to program a kuka robot arm. The code i did recently was programming an arduino, however i only muddled my way through it.

In terms of past experience, one of the big advantages i have is that i've taken a course in formal logic and it was one of the most life-changing courses ive done at uni - coincidentally it fell at the same time i was learning grasshopper, which was my first intro to programming. Now im here, funny how things happen.

Anyway! its exciting to see this come back in to relevance in python. I think i fell in love with the relationship between language and mathematics. It has a real beauty to it that's difficult to express. Perhaps its just satisfying to bring concrete rules to topics that are often thought of to be abstract and emotive. I got this same feeling after reading Roland Bathes Mythologies. The discovery of semiotics as topic open my eyes. I hope this course does the same. i think alot of this feeling is why i love design so much. The creativity of logic and emotion. Left and right brain etc.

I love trinket! Its really great to be able to copy and paste and think about things at a more high level without having to worry about the name of things and the right syntax. It reminds me alot of grasshopper

Article reflection:

http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html - why am i just hearing this now?? haha this is gold! i thought i was the weird one. I think thats such an important factor that gets overlooked when trying to make something. i think it took me a while to learn that this is the way i work as well. To commit myself to one task for a chunk of time instead of doing multiple different things and my brain and thinking is all over the place. I think one of the most interesting things i heard in the lecture was the idea of leaving things in a nice place for your future self. Now that someone has said this to me, i think i'll be more active in actually doing it. Im gonna start naming my layers in photoshop! (thats so unbelievable to me it sounds like a joke hahaha)
