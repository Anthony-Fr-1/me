I've been getting immense satisfaction when something works in python. I find myself doing very hacky things to make things work. I can tell they are hacky because often when I watch a tutorial they will describe the method im using as hacky haahaha

I think i realised something really cool which was pandas works like this:

1. what am I trying to find?
2. how do i sort the data to show the thing i want
3. (sometimes put that sorted data into variable like x and y when comparing)
4. plot x and y

not very profound, but important for me to get my head around. Before I was viewing matplotlib, python and pandas all as seperate things. But im not sure what happened this week but something clicked. Its always nice when that happens.

Some good videos/resources I found:
