// notes
I dont understand why we use the letter i
as in for i in range (10)

answer: i, j and k are often used for loop variables - its just the way things are apparently
is this related to algebra? or is it specifically those 3 letters?

//Readings

Ladder of abstraction
ok so i read the ladder of abstraction. I dont think im ready to reflect on it because i dont know if I've had that profound thought yet. Its the kind of reading that you know is a gold mine and will make you see things in a completely new light. Perhaps i just need a coffee and I'll see that it actually is the amazing text that i think it is. hahaha

The digital computer as a creative medium
i love reading this stuff. I can't help but think about the things that im currently "shrugging" off as being insignificant. I guess im learning to code now and thats something everyone tells you to do hey hahaha.

        I think i've been reading too much about creativity and computers lately because i was on the edge of my seat waiting for them to say "Alan Turing". Can't belive they waited until page 3.

        "Predictions of the future are risky in that they may be really nothing more than what the person predicting would like to see occur" - PROFOUND!

        not a bad conclusion, i generally agree with that sentiment re. the role of the artist etc

//reflection

I'll be honest...i'm still not getting it :(

all the elements are there in my brain but something is just missing. Someone in the clinic said it best. They are just waiting for things to "click". I've been trying to think about the problem from a higher stand point. Perhaps a process of, "what am i trying to do", what is the big picture here. I feel that blocks are really good for this, less scary perhaps because it won't let you get a syntax error.

A friend of mine let me know about a website called w3 which to me feels a bit like blocks, because i can look something up and copy it in. I feel this is the way I learnt grasshopper, just struggling and doing a lot of copying and pasting until i started to think about how to solve problems.

Yes i've had feelings of giving up, its only natural when learning something new. This reminds me of when I learnt formal logic and arguments. I couldnt get my head around modus ponens, tautologies etc. but all of a sudden it just clicked and it felt like i could bring a little more sense to the world. Maybe python will unlock the secrets of the universe? im not sure... answer = 42

Values
•
• Integer means a whole counting number
• Float - floating point decimal - basically just decimal number
• Boolean or Bool - descirbe binary logical questions - true or false - answer to logical questions - boolean questions control a program
• String - text - can also be treat numbers as a string, not the number
Variables
• Similar to algebra
•
• My_variable - is the name
• = - is the assignment operator - puts the value into the variable
• Give your variables good names
○ Programming is written for humans to understand and computers to incidentally understand
○ Keystrokes are free - the computer doesn’t care how long the title of the variable is - make them descriptive
Expressions
• Something you can resolve
• Follows bodmas - order of precedents matters
• Can manage this by adding brackets
Functions
• Improve the usability of your code
• Def - is a function definition
Collections
• Lists
• Square brackets []
• The first thing is 0
• Homogenous of heterogenous list of strings and numbers
• Tupel - number of things round brackets () - not functions
• Dictionaries - key: value pairs
•
Flow control
•
• Else handles situations where the if is not true
•
• Elif - if something is == to something else
• If something is equal to something else
Iteration
• Doing a process over and over again
• Reading a book is an iteration
