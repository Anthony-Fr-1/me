Sketchpad

It's incredible to think about how fundamental this method of creating geometries is as the basis for all of our current CAD software. I've seen a video on sketchpad before but every time I see it being used, I'm still amazed that they were doing this in 1962.

"The Future of Programming" - Bret Victor

I think once the novelty of this video wore off I started to realise just how insightful it was to thinking about where we have come from in terms of programming. Once again, the idea that the human should come first in programming languages rang true. With every example he showed, we could see increasingly accessible and more human-centric designs for machine interactions. I particularly liked that they were thinking about flowcharts to program as this seems to be the basis for grasshopper and coding blocks, which are both ways of programming that I really enjoy.

The idea that a computer can be understood however we as humans design it to be was actually quite a profound thought. I think of so many other languages, notations and diagrammatic systems that are bound by the traditions of that field

One example would be something like music. Music is written in a notation language and thus is bound by a person being able to read and interpret that language. Whereas guitar tabs notation is more on the diagrammatic side and is "easier" to read for beginners.

technology changes quickly, peoples minds change slowly
computers will change with time - moores law - but peoples minds wont change in this same linear way
there was resistance with the changes in ways of programming - people didnt want to change from binary to soap
people had to unlearn what they knew and do things differently
the most dangerous thought you can have as a creative is thinking that you know what you're doing. becuase once you think you know what you're doing, you stop looking around for other ways of doing things - you stop being able to see what else is possible
the first step is to say - i dont know what im doing and i dont know what a computer is. once you do this then you are free to think differently
how can we represent data visually - using diagrams and visualling lists of data
representing programming spatially by using video screens
programming with flowcharts - grail 1968

nobody knew what programming was supposed to be
In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it.
In engineering if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it.
Of course, you seldom, if ever, see either pure state.
