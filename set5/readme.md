I'm starting to get the hang of python, I think I'm making less syntax errors and I'm able to focus much more on the process of what I'm trying to do. I think starting to think about code a little more an think about how the computer needs to understand things. Its a bit like having a conversation with a computer. Telling it what the parameters and the rules are in a language it understands. I think the loops are a remarkably simple concept but incredibly powerful. The more I look at other code in the wild the more I'm realising that its all just made of the same stuff

Computational design is really not design at all. It’s a tool in the designers kit. Addressing friction points in the computer process and designing tools/workflows to overcome these issues

Its about automating things and creating a process. How does data change geometry?

- a process to create geometries
- what are the limits of the geometry
- what can the geometry do and what cant it do.

So I think it’s important to take these tools as just tools and not fall into the trap of techno-determinism.

Making sure that it’s only to increase our productivity and not to sacrifice our creativity. I’m interested in how these tools can help the creative process rather than block it. Can we create things that are more tangible like sketches or model-making and let the computer figure out the rest?

Science/Design

    Computational design is more a scientific approach to design. So it often lacks the emotional appeal of its designs in favour of more engineer focussed solutions. But I think it’s interesting where Nike is heading. By being able to combine sports science and design through a merging of these two computational processes, you get a sort of hybrid of design intent captured in the outcome.  The function can be better implemented and data led
