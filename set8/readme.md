I was watching this video and it got me thinking about data collection in design - perhaps a primitive form of data but a very informative and useful form of data. The methods of custom are coming back and being liberated with code and automation. Itâ€™s easier to collect data like this and then make something custom.

Data collection and mass customisation are made possible with computer controlled manufacturing processes - This kind of thing to make the hats reminds me of the manufacturing panels on the dongdaemun design plaza

or even perhaps the way nike collects heat map data of feet to make shoes

Nike are big on using attractor points from this heat map data, particularly with their flyknit and epic react shoes. The can control the stiffness and flexibility in the sole and shoe
