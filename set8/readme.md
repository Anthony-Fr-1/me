Recursion guest lecture

Alot of interesting things were said in the guest lecture but I think i'm too new to programming to really grasp these ideas. So i made some notes about things that i'll probably want to look back on in the future

Formal question of computability
Programming language concepts
Structure and interpretation of computer programs - a really good book on approaches to designing computer systems and how algorithms should work
The little lisper - is a good book about how to write recursive functions
Loop unrolling - concept
The little schemer book
Markdown - structured text language
Yaml is like a json that’s a bit more readable
Robant - robot servant - Philip K Dick, - example codes
Mechanical sympathy

The exam

I was nervous for this exam leading up to it, but I actually found it to be quite forgiving being able to run the test while completing the exam. I wish I had a feature like that for all my exams. I think I sort of suprised myself with how much i knew, not to say I did well, but to say that I didnt think I would do well at all. I think the time pressure to complete the exercises made me really think about the problem and attack it in a structured way, rather than how I had been working before which was just messing about until the tests passed. I found the length of time to be ok as well, i was definitely pushed at the end but I think in the end it was ok

Data collection in design

I've been thinking alot about how we can describe geometry using something more like a data table than a 3d form. Typically im used to designing things by directly making a surface or spline etc, but perhaps some of these traditional processes are more like designing something with data points

Conformatuer - a device that is used to make custom fitting hats

I was watching this video and it got me thinking about data collection in design - perhaps a primitive form of data but a very informative and useful form of data. The methods of custom are coming back and being liberated with code and automation. It’s easier to collect data like this and then make something custom.

Data collection and mass customisation are made possible with computer controlled manufacturing processes - This kind of thing to make the hats reminds me of the manufacturing panels on the dongdaemun design plaza

or even perhaps the way nike collects heat map data of feet to make shoes

Nike are big on using attractor points from this heat map data, particularly with their flyknit and epic react shoes. The can control the stiffness and flexibility in the sole and shoe

I was also watching this video:

I love the early use of CAD (around the 6:30 mark). They use something that looks very much like Sketchpad and then use that data to feed instructions into a CNC machine

I also love how the translate a physical object into a series of data points and dimensions. Gets me thinking about the ways to design things with a more computational mindset, thinking more about it as numbers and data rather than literally drawing lines and curves.

I took some screenshots to show some of their measurement processes

They use a kind of pantograph machine to plot the point onto paper
