Data collection in design

I've been thinking alot about how we can describe geometry using something more like a data table than a 3d form. Typically im used to designing things by directly making a surface or spline etc, but perhaps some of these traditional processes are more like designing something with data points

Conformatuer - a device that is used to make custom fitting hats

I was watching this video and it got me thinking about data collection in design - perhaps a primitive form of data but a very informative and useful form of data. The methods of custom are coming back and being liberated with code and automation. Itâ€™s easier to collect data like this and then make something custom.

Data collection and mass customisation are made possible with computer controlled manufacturing processes - This kind of thing to make the hats reminds me of the manufacturing panels on the dongdaemun design plaza

or even perhaps the way nike collects heat map data of feet to make shoes

Nike are big on using attractor points from this heat map data, particularly with their flyknit and epic react shoes. The can control the stiffness and flexibility in the sole and shoe

I was also watching this video:

I love the early use of CAD (around the 6:30 mark). They use something that looks very much like Sketchpad and then use that data to feed instructions into a CNC machine

I also love how the translate a physical object into a series of data points and dimensions. Gets me thinking about the ways to design things with a more computational mindset, thinking more about it as numbers and data rather than literally drawing lines and curves.

I took some screenshots to show some of their measurement processes
